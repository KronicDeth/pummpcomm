# Pummpcomm

Pummpcomm is an Elixir library to handle communication with a Medtronic insulin pump via a serial link to a cc1110 chip running subg_rfspy. It is inspired by the work of Ben West's [decocare](https://github.com/openaps/decocare). It can run commands, receive responses, and decode multipacket history and cgm data.
